# 1.3. Java Collections (Level 1 - Exercise 3)

## Project Description üìÑ

This Java project solves the following exercise:

"
Given the file countries.txt (check the resources section) containing countries and capitals. The program must read the file and save the data in a HashMap<String, String>. The program asks for the user's name, and then must show a country randomly, saved in HashMap. It is that the user must write the name of the capital of the country in question. If the right is added a point. This action is repeated 10 times. Once the capitals of 10 countries have been requested randomly, then it must be stored in a file called classification.txt, the name of the user and their score.".

The goal is to gain hands-on experience with file I/O, collections, user input, and randomization in Java, all while building a simple but interactive application.
